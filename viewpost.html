                        Hi Folks,
                        RockChip released a new flash tool 2.1 which allows you to DUMP entire NAND memory from your RK device.
                        However it is not a fully automated process.  It takes some know how to do it.
                        Fortunately I figured it all out for you and will explain below exactly how to do it.

                        WARNING RIGHT UP FRONT!
                        I have tested all this on several devices and for me it worked 100%
                        Tronsmart T428
                        CX-919
                        Pipo M9 Pro
                        Minix X7

                        But this does not mean you can’t screw up or it ALWAYS works!
                        You are on your own and assume your own risks!
                        BIG NOTE:
                        This is really for backing up and restoring.  This is NOT for trying to recover from a brick!
                        So only use this if you know how to flash a ROM and have a ROM available you know works already!
                        The reason is this procedure will not be flashing loader or repartitioning NAND!
                        Thus you need a good loader from a good ROM already flashed on your device!
                        In fact to even backup, your device must be working or this will get you no where!

                        What this really does is replace CWM (ClockWork Mod) in a way.
                        It's faster than CWM and you can backup things CWM does not.

                        Also what this is totally useful for is to backup a stock ROM!
                        If you do not have a stock ROM available for download for your device, this will back it up!
                        You do not have to backup the user data stuff to be able to flash your stock backed up ROM. :)

                        Very cool and about time Rockchip!


                        OK so that’s it!
                        Enjoy this cool new way to backup :)
                    </p>
